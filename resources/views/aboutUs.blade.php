                Missing Persons Kenya is a community led portal that works with organizations and individuals in the human
                protection sector and the public to help share information on missing persons using various media platforms
                and increase search efforts at no cost to the affected families.</br>
                The goal of Missing Person Kenya is to boost search efforts for missing people by sharing photo posters and
                alerts to as broad an audience and in the fastest time possible.
